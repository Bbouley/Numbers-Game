###Rules
1. There are two players (one player, one AI)
2. Each player writes a number, hidden from the other player. It can be any integer.
3. The players reveal their numbers.
4. Whoever chose the lower number gets 1 point, unless the lower number is lower only by 1, then the player with the higher number gets 2 points.
5. If they both choose the same number, neither player gets a point.
6. This repeats and the game ends when a player has 5 points.
